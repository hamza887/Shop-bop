# Shop-Bop
  Shop-Bop is an Ecommerce website just (last year I was working on the some of the shopify stores so thats how I got the idea of working on my own store right building everything from scratch, It is a department store. The store sells electronics, clothing, and jewelry. Each category has a link provided for you to navigate easily through the site.
This project was deployed to netlify, heres the link: "Link Coming Soon"

# Inspiration For The Project
          Everyone Loves to Shop Online, its booming in these days and ecommerce has been grown into billions of dollars of industry. I personally love to shop online and that is the reason I built this by using an api

# MVP GOALS
Have a nav with all the components linked to it.
I did not want the clothing / products to just be rendered onto the page immediately.
The components must each act as a source of it’s own being that they were different categories.
Have at least one API fetch call to render the required info for the clothing, electronics, and jewelry.
Stretch Goals
To have another component composed of another API call for some Rick and Morty Fun. ( I had this idea come to me, when some of the stores I had often visited online, always have a page for random photos of customers, and since I don’t have actual testimonials from customers, I decided to have a little fun.)
Have a cart with some functionality, where you click remove for all the items in the cart. 3 I would like to add music to my homepage just for some fun.

# Technologies Used

Javascript
React
CSS
React-router-dom
React-Bootstrap

# Getting STARTED TO USE THE APP

1.Fork 
2. Clone down the repo.
3. Once it’s in your remote repository, cd into the file (make sure you're in the react file). Install dependencies. 
4. Yarn add react-bootstrap. 
5. Yarn add react-router-dom. 
6. Once you have the dependencies on the forked and clone version in your remote repository, run Yarn start. -If you notice, your package.json file should have all the dependencies and their versions listed under the dependencies. -Another thing you can notice is that your file should have a yarn.lock, and the node modules. -You should be set to go after these.

# HOW TO CONTRIBUTE

You can add and increment (+) and decrement (-) amount for the cart purchases on each item
Add some music to the homepage or the Rick and Morty page.
There can be other components to build out the store more, like shoes, and bags.
Validation for the cart component like the consumers card used and their email info.
Some styling, instead of using Bootstrap and creating a card for each item in your own css styling and making it web-responsive.
Refactor using redux.
A special thank you to the API creators that made it possible to make this project come together:
